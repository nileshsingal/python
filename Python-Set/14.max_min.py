#14. Write a Python program to find maximum and the minimum value in a set.

set1 = {17,29,30,50,64,39,275,4,3,1,46,6}

max1 = max(set1)
min1 = min(set1)
print("Maximum element in the set is : ",max1)
print("Minimum element in the set is : ",min1)


# Alternate Method

'''

set1 = {17,29,30,50,64,39,275,4,3,1,46,6}
print("Maximum element in the set is : ",max(set1))
print("Minimum element in the set is : ",min(set1))
